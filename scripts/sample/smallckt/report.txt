The code for generating the linear approximation table is in the file lat.hs in which genc is encoded circuit and gout is the circuit with the correct keys
The correct key for the given circuit is (k1,k2,k3,k4) = 1011 
In the file lat.txt the linear approximation table is given and we have made different functions according to the equations of linear approximation 
(for bias values 8,7,-7 ) the functions probb1,probb3,probca,proba4b2 can be used to get the probability of the keys to be the correct keys , we have used 20 test cases (for circuit having 5 inputs and 3 outputs and 4 keys )
for the ighest bias case we got 2 answers with equal probability -- 0001 and 0011 for the rest of the cases we got more than one keys having the same probability .
